## TL;DR
Defines core concepts of the web bot detection problem space and does an deep dive on the privacy regulatory landscape (mostly focused on GDPR). It touches briefly on some techniques that could be used to preserve privacy while providing solid detections.

## Notes
- Great reference section with a few leads to continue investigating the problem space.

## Thoughts
- I liked the taxonomy of the different bot detection methods. One of the best I have seen thus far.
- I liked the the advanced bot techniques section, which included a definition of good and bad bots.
- I liked the comprehensive explanation on the existing legistation and how companies work around it.

- I missed an actual implementation example of the privacy preserving bot detection techniques.
