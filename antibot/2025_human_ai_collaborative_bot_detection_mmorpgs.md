## TL;DR
This paper presents an unsupervised framework for detecting auto‑leveling bots in MMORPGs by grouping similar player progression patterns and using a large language model (LLM) as a secondary reviewer to improve explainability and moderation decisions. The human‑AI collaboration enhances bot detection without labeled training data while helping reduce false positives. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
