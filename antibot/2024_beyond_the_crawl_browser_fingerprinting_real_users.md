## TL;DR
This paper analyzes the web fingerprinting techniques used today in many websites using real-user telemetry data captured by a custom Chrome extension.

## Notes
- Great reference section with a few leads to continue investigating the problem space.
- Great reverse engineering approach for fingerprinting detection.

## Thoughts
- I liked the taxonomy on browser fingerprinting techniques.
- I liked the inclusion of Federated Learning and Differential Privacy for cases were data locality or anonymity is key.
- I liked that it actually builds up on top of existing research as opposed to just name dropping.

- I missed a bigger sample size (30 people). Nevertheless, the results were illustrative.
